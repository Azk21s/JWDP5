### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the entire repo (not just the front folder). From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
